        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef Stroganoff or Beef Stroganov is an originally Russian dish of sautéed pieces of beef served in a sauce of mustard and smetana (sour cream). From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe. Mushrooms are common in many variants. </p>
